At first we move to the required folder or file with the help of cd folder name
Then step 2 we move to specific folder with the help of cd 
Then we do git init it will initialize empty git repo in the folder
It is a hidden file we can view it by checking view hidden file
git status will give us all the information of the folders or file 
git add .(all files) will be used to add the file which needs to be commited
if we make any changes and check status again it will show the made changes.
then use git commit -m "text made changes" all the files will be commited.
Then again we can check the status it will show nothing to commit, working tree clean
Then we do git remote and origin and https of git both are connected
then we can push it using the git push -u origin name.
the file will be pushed.
echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Yaseenarafat998/name.git
git push -u origin main
when creating a branch we can
git checkout -b branch name 
then we need to add , commit, and push and refresh we will find the new branch
